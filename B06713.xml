            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>WE are now arrived in our Paſſage Eaſtward as far as the <hi>Indies,</hi> where the firſt Springs of that Learning which afterwards flow'd always Weſtward, aroſe. Thither <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is ſaid to have gone, and to have fetch'd from thence his celebrated Doctrine of the <hi>Tranſmigration of Souls,</hi> which he taught, and is now believed by the Modern <hi>Bramines</hi> as it was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Brachmans</hi> of old.</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:180079:3"/>
                     <p> We have very little if any Account of theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Philoſophers before <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> who extended his Conqueſts as far as the River <hi>Indus.</hi> His Hiſtorians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with a Set of Philoſophers in that Countrey, who practiſed great Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities themſelves, and taught others that Wiſdom lay in living upon a little, in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from almoſt all ſorts of Natural Pleaſures, and Promoting the Proſperity and Welfare of the reſt of Mankind. The Deſcription that <hi>Strabo</hi> gives us of them, out of <hi>Megaſthenes, Oneſicritus</hi> and <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi> which is very well Abridged by Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> is the Fulleſt and moſt Authentic that we have. And that the Body of it may be true, is probable from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of their Succeſſors the <hi>Bramines,</hi> which are given us by Monſieur <hi>Bernier,</hi> and <hi>Abraham Roger,</hi> who lived many Years among them, and made it their Buſineſs to collect their Opinions with all the Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they could.</p>
                     <p>The ſuperſtitious Care which theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take to follow the Cuſtoms, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Opinions of their Anceſtors, be they never ſo abſurd and ſenſeleſs, plainly ſhews that they would have preſerved their Learning with equal Care, had there been any of it to preſerve. They keep a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the wiſe Sayings of one <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throuherri,</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:180079:3"/> which Monſieur <hi>Roger</hi> has given us a Taſt of; but ſuch miſerable Stuff, for the generality, that one cannot read them without ſmiling at the Simplicity of thoſe that can admire them. They wou'd not ſhew Monſieur <hi>Roger</hi> their Book of the Law, which they pretend to be ſent from God; but by the Account which his <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> Doctor gave of it, it is only an abſurd Hiſtory of the fabulous Succeſſions of their Deities, and as abſurd a Collection of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Ceremonies, by which they were to be worſhipped. Their Doctrine of the <hi>Tranſmigration of Souls,</hi> which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> firſt taught in the Weſt, is a precarious idle Notion, which theſe beſotted <hi>Indians</hi> do ſo blindly believe, that they are afraid of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Flea or a Louſe, for fear of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul of one of their Anceſtors. Though at the ſame time they ſcruple not to force multitudes of poor ſilly Women, and ſometimes too, full ſore againſt their Wills, to burn themſelves alive with their deceaſed Husband's Bodies, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their being ſerviceable to them in another World, though they are far from having any aſſurance that their Husbands will there ſtand in need of them. Can we believe that there is a generous Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in a People, who have now for MM or MMM Years placed the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180079:4"/> of Sanctity and Prudence in half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarving themſelves, and depriving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the lawful Conveniences of Life? Yet theſe were the chiefeſt Employments of the Ancient <hi>Brachmans,</hi> as they are ſtill of the Modern <hi>Bramines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that there is reaſon to fear that the Stories of the extraordinary Wiſdom of the Ancient <hi>Brachmans</hi> are in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure fabulous, becauſe in the idle and bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted part of the Narrative they do ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly agree with the Modern <hi>Bramines;</hi> and alſo, becauſe if one conſults what the Ancients have recorded of the <hi>Brachmans</hi> in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time, which is all gathered into a Body by <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Palladius de Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Indiae, &amp; Bragmanibus</hi> Edit.

For, upon comparing what all thoſe Authors there quoted have ſaid, I am enclinable to believe, that all we know of the Ancient <hi>Brachmans,</hi> is due to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Companions have given us.</p>
                     <p>But let us enter into Particulars. Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> tells us, out of <hi>Strabo;</hi>

                        <q>All theſe ſtrange Impertinencies, which I have had the patience to relate, have often made me think, that if <hi>they</hi> be thoſe famous Sciences of the Ancient <hi>Brachmans</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> very many have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the great Opinion they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of them. For my part, I can hardly believe it, but that I find the Religion of the <hi>Indians</hi> to be from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial Times; that 'tis written in the <hi>Hanſcrit</hi> Language, which cannot but be very ancient, ſince its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is unknown, and 'tis a <hi>dead</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, not underſtood but by the Learned; that <hi>all</hi> their Books are only written in that Tongue: all which

                     <p>Yet one Notion of theſe <hi>Bramines</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice of, becauſe it is a very Philoſophical one, and has been with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability ſtarted and defended by ſome of the moſt curious Anatomiſts of the preſent Age, who built their Hypotheſis upon the lateſt Diſcoveries which have been made in that admirable Art: I ſhall ſet it down in Monſieur <hi>Bernier</hi>'s words; <note n="(l)" place="margin">P. 175, 176.</note>

                     <p>THE <hi>Ancients</hi> put ſo great a Value upon the Country-man's Arts, and we have ſo many Treatiſes ſtill extant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, written by their greateſt Philoſophers, their ableſt Philologers, and their beſt Poets; that to ſay nothing of them, may be thought an inexcuſable Omiſſion. <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Gardening</hi> are Subjects upon which <hi>Theophraſtus (Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s Darling Diſciple,) <hi>Varro</hi> (who is ſaid to be the Learnedeſt of all the <hi>Romans,)</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> (perhaps no-way his inferior) have written large Diſcourſes yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> quote Numbers of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180079:7"/> ſome of them no leſs than Crowned Heads, ſince loſt. <hi>Heſiod,</hi> whom ſome of the Ancients make older than <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> the Prince of <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, have left us Precepts of theſe Arts. <hi>Columella</hi> ſays, they are related to Philoſophy it ſelf, which thoſe Heathen Sages priz'd ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And the later <hi>Roman</hi> Writers are ſtill upbraiding the Luxury of their own Times, which wholly took off their Minds from theſe moſt uſeful Employments, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their effeminate Country-men back to their renowned Anceſtors who went from the Plough to the Camp, and having there commanded victorious Armies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back again to the Plough, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Time they had loſt.</p>
                     <p>There is no doubt but great Things were done in theſe Arts by the Ancients: Had we no Books extant to acquaint us with their Knowledge, yet the thing ſhews it ſelf: Countries cannot be peopled by civilized Nations, nor great Cities fill'd, nor Trade carried on by polite and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Inhabitants, unleſs the Arts of Husbandry flouriſh. Mankind, without them, would be Wild, like the <hi>Negroes,</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Salvages, or <hi>Arabs.</hi> But yet one Nation may be much more Knowing in theſe Things than another, and one Age conſequently, though all may have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180079:7"/> Skill enough to anſwer the Neceſſities of Civil Life.</p>
                     <p>In making my Compariſon, I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all that the Ancients underſtood by their <hi>Res Ruſtica,</hi> as it takes in the <hi>Foreſter</hi>'s, the <hi>Husbandman</hi>'s, and the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener</hi>'s Buſineſs: <hi>Cato, Varro,</hi> and <hi>Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella</hi> include the <hi>Grafier</hi>'s alſo, thereby compleating the whole Body of <hi>Farming;</hi> but ſince his Work cannot well be made a Science of, I ſhall omit it.</p>
                     <p>By a <hi>Foreſter</hi> here, I underſtand one that knows how to Plant, Propagate and Encreaſe all ſorts of Timber Trees; what Soils are proper for every ſort; how they may beſt be defended from Dangers in their Growth; to what Uſes they are moſt applicable, when they have arrived to their utmoſt Perfection; and how they may be beſt applied: Such a Man, in ſhort, as Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> inſtructs in his <hi>Sylva,</hi> where he gives a full Syſtem of the <hi>Woodman</hi>'s Skill; what he ought to know, and what to practiſe. A great part of his Work, and indeed the Niceſt part of it, the Ancients were Strangers to, as having leſs occaſion for it. The World was then, comparatively ſpeaking, in its Infancy; there was no want of Wood for Fuel, Building, or Ships; and this Plenty made Men leſs curious in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180079:8"/> Methods of Preſerving what they had in ſo great abundance. <hi>England,</hi> till within a few Ages, was every where over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Wood: The <hi>Hercynian</hi> Foreſt anciently took up what is now the moſt flouriſhing part of <hi>Germany:</hi> And <hi>France,</hi> which is at preſent ſo wonderfully Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that little Cultivable Ground remains Untill'd, was in <hi>Caeſars</hi>'s time over-ſpread with Woods and Foreſts. As Men encreaſe, Tillage becomes more and more requiſite; the conſumption of Wood will be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably greater; and its want, and the neceſſary Uſes of Timber, which grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men as they become more numerous, will of conſequence put them upon ways to preſerve and encreaſe it. Commerce with diſtant Parts, will ſhew Men rare and uſeful Trees, to which their own Soil was before a ſtranger; and Luxury will ſoon teach them to tranſplant them.</p>
                     <p>No wonder therefore if Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters excell the Ancients, upon a Subject which they had leſs occaſion for. The <hi>Romans,</hi> indeed, were curious in Planting Trees for Shade or Fruit; but their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in that particular comes under another Head, as rather belonging to the <hi>Gardener</hi>'s Work. It may therefore, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be eſteemed a ſmall Character of Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi>'s <hi>Diſcourſe of Foreſt Trees,</hi> to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180079:8"/> ſay, that it Out-does all that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> have left us on that Subject: For it not only does that, and a great deal more, but contains more uſeful Precepts, Hints and Diſcoveries upon that now ſo neceſſary a part of our <hi>Res Ruſtica,</hi> than the World had till then known from all the Obſervations of former Ages. To name others after him, would be a derogation to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agriculture</hi> properly ſo called, has been always neceſſary ſince <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, when the Flood, that <hi>deſtroy'd the World of the Ungodly,</hi> wrought ſuch a change upon the Face of the Earth, as made it neceſſary for all Mankind <hi>in the ſweat of their brows to eat their bread.</hi> And the early Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of the Eaſtern Nations, (though I would not bring <hi>Semiramis</hi> and <hi>Zoroaſter</hi>'s Armies to prove it) ſhews how much it was followed. For though thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſhould be allowed to be, as they really are, marvellouſly Fruitful; yet even <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Plains of <hi>Babylonia,</hi> muſt be Tilled, to yield a Crop to ſatisfie the Hunger of their Inhabitants. Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the World was later Peopled, ſo Tillage was proportionably later; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> tell of one <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> who learn'd the Art of Sowing Corn of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180079:9"/> the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> above a Thouſand Years after <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood <hi>(c).</hi> After that, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <note place="margin">

                        </note> taught them many Rules; and it is evident from <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers of <hi>Geoponic's,</hi> that their Knowledge in this kind was very great. They were thoroughly verſed in the Art of Dreſſing their Grounds, and the Seaſons when it was proper to do every part of a Husbandman's Work: what Compoſt was fit to meliorate their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought or barren Lands; what Soil was beſt for this Grain, and what for that. Their Vines and Olives, which were their Farmer's care, were managed with much Skill and Curioſity; and <hi>Pliny</hi> reckons up a great many ſorts of both of them, which the Luxury of that Age had taught them to cultivate. In a word; They were Induſtrious and Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Husbandmen; and perhaps, 'tis not poſſible to tell, at this diſtance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Farmers manage their Grounds more judiciouſly than they did theirs: ſince any Improvements particular to one Climate and Soil, do not prove that Age in which they are made, more Knowing than another, wherein ſuch Improvements could take no place: though at the ſame time, a Countrey naturally barren, which has a weak Sun in an unkindly Climate,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:180079:9"/> requires more Skill, as well as more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, to make it fertile. And therefore it may be queſtion'd, whether, conſidering the Natural Felicity of the Soils of <hi>Sicily, Africa</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and much more of <hi>Aegypt, Judaea</hi> and <hi>Babylonia,</hi> whoſe Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility was anciently, with Reaſon, ſo much extolled, the Improvements in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> may not juſtly come into competition with any ancient Performances; which how great ſoever in themſelves, were yet leſs upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the Husbandmen in thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions had not ſuch Difficulties to ſtruggle with.</p>
                     <p>But though the Ancients, probably, underſtood the Art of Sowing Wheat, and Barley, and Legumes, and Flax, and how to manage their Vines and Olives, as well as any Age has done ſince; yet other things of unſpeakable uſe they were wholly ſtrangers to. The Art of Making <hi>Cyder,</hi> at leaſt of Chuſing the beſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Managing their Orchards and Plantations accordingly, they knew little or nothing of. And here again I muſt remember to take notice, (which, upon every opportunity, I gladly do,) that Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi>'s <hi>Pomona</hi> has taught the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age many things concerning the way of Ordering Apple-Trees, and Making
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180079:10"/> 
                        <hi>Cyder,</hi> to which the World, till then, were wholly Strangers, and for which he ought here to be mention'd with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The <hi>Sugar-Cane</hi> was not ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown, ſince it grows naturally in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Indoſtan;</hi> but ſo little was the Old World acquainted with the Nature of its delicious Juice, that ſome of their ableſt Men doubted whether it were a Dew like Manna, or the Juice of the Plant it ſelf. All the Arts and Methods therefore of Preparing Sugar, which have made it ſo very uſeful to Humane Life, are owing to Modern <hi>Portuguezes</hi> and <hi>Engliſh. Malt-Drinks</hi> were uſed in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> anciently; as alſo in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where, probably, they were firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but whether they were ſo accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made as ours, no Man can tell, unleſs he knew certainly whether and with what they fermented them. May I not farther inſtance in <hi>Coffee</hi> and <hi>Tobacco?</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> drove a greater Trade in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and were better acquainted with its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, than this part of the World has been at any time ſince, which no Man that has ever read the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Book of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> can poſſibly doubt of; yet there is no one Syllable of any thing like <hi>Coffee</hi> in his whole Work, nor indeed in any other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180079:10"/> Ancient Author before the <hi>Arabs.</hi> It is very probable that it grows wild in <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſince it is known to grow no where elſe; and that the Prohibition of Wine by the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, made the <hi>Arabs</hi> find out its Virtues, (whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a neglected Shrub) to ſupply the place of the other Liquor. But ſtill its Cultivation is, as to the preſent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Modern; and ſince the <hi>Arabs</hi> do now beſtow great Care and Pains in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging it, it comes not improperly in among the Augmentations of <hi>Modern Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture.</hi> And that <hi>Tobacco</hi> ought here to be mention'd, is queſtion'd by none who know what a Delight and Refreſhment it is to ſo many Nations, ſo many ſeveral ways. The Accounts of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Braſil</hi> will inform us what pains our <hi>Europaean</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are at, to make that Herb palatable to all ſorts of Perſons. So that without taking notice of any more Particulars, we may be aſſured, that the <hi>Modern Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi> is a <hi>larger,</hi> if not a more <hi>exact</hi> thing than the <hi>Ancient;</hi> and even in thoſe things wherein the Ancients did moſt excell, in the Management of their Vines and Olives, the comparative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the later Ages will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be allowed by all thoſe who are acquainted with the Curioſity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:180079:11"/> in Managing of their Fruit-Trees; which ſhall be treated of in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>I deferred to ſpeak of <hi>Gardening</hi> till the laſt; becauſe Luxury always comes after Neceſſity; though, generally, when it is once introduced, it ſtill goes on encreaſing, till it is come to the utmoſt pitch to which it can be carried. In the preſent Subject, we ſhall find a gradual Improvement ſo very viſible, that I hope to put it paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
                     <p>The Babylonian <hi>Horti Penſiles,</hi> or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on the tops of Buildings, ought, in moſt Men's Opinion, firſt to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in point of Antiquity. Theſe, <hi>Joſephus</hi> aſſures us, were only large Walks of Trees planted on the tops of Mounts of Maſons Work, erected in the midſt of the City by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to pleaſe his Wife. If they are no older, <hi>Alcinous</hi>'s Garden, deſcribed by <hi>Homer</hi> 
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Odyſſ.</hi> lib. viii.</note>, was long before them. There one ſees the Simplicity of that Heroical Age very plainly. The Poet thought he did a magnificent thing, when he made it Four Acres in circumference: He tells us, it was ſtored with Pear-Trees and Apple-Trees, Pomegranates and Figs, Vines and Olives, which furniſhed him with conſtant ſucceſſions of Fruit; and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180079:11"/> had two Fountains, one cut into Streams, to water it within; the other flowing from thence, to ſupply the Neceſſities of the Inhabitants of the Town. And this is all he ſays of it: Poets and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers deſcribe every thing for their Hero's uſes, as ſplendidly as they can, what they have ſeen, read, or heard of, is always brought in, as 'tis expected it ſhould. Accordingly the Garden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Euſtathius</hi> 
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Yſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae &amp; Yſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> l. i.</note>, in the later times of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Empire, when Luxury was improved into an Art, which it was far from being in old <hi>Homer</hi>'s time, is much finer, though far ſhort of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and <hi>Villa</hi>'s of the Princes and Great Men of the preſent Age. <hi>Euſtathius</hi>'s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den has open and arched Walks of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Cypreſs and Myrtle, with Arbors of Vines for the Conveniencies of the Gueſts, to gather the Grapes as they lay at their Meals by the Fountain-ſide; with a <hi>Jet d'eau</hi> in the middle of it, ſpouting Water out of an Eagle's Bill; by which a She-Goat was milked, with the Liquor dropping out of the Nipples into a Pail on purpoſe: round the Fountain are Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Peacocks, Doves and Cocks, all either Caſt or Carved, out of whoſe Bills the Water flowing, gave a Sound to the ſeveral Birds. This indeed is very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180079:12"/> pleaſant and poetical, and ſhews, that <hi>Euſtathius</hi> had ſeen or heard of ſomething of this nature, by which he guided his Fancy.</p>
                     <p>What the <hi>Roman</hi> Gardens were, we are ſufficiently taught by their Writers of <hi>Countrey Affairs:</hi> 
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Lib. x. <hi>tot. &amp;</hi> lib. xi. cap. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Columella</hi>'s and <note n="(r)" place="margin">Lib. xix.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Precepts and Deſcriptions are fit for nothing elſe but a Kitchen-Garden: They give Directions for Ordering Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, Melons, Artichokes, Coleworts, Turneps, Radiſhes, Parſnips, Skirrets, Garlick, Leeks, Onions, Aſparagus, and a numerous train of Pot-Herbs, with a little Garden-Phyſic. They both aſſign this as the reaſon why <hi>Virgil</hi> would ſay nothing of Gardening, in his <hi>Georgic's;</hi> it being a Subject ſo very poor and jejune, that it would not bear the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which that Divine Poet gave to all his Works: So they ſeem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his <hi>Spatia iniqua</hi> which he complains of, upon which account he left off where he did.</p>
                     <p>For if we fanſie that the Gardens of <hi>Lucullus, Pompey, Cicero, Mecoenas, Seneca,</hi> and of all thoſe Great <hi>Romans</hi> which are ſo highly extolled by the Ancients, were what we ordinarily call Gardens, we are very much miſtaken: Their Gardens were ſpacious Plats of Ground, filled and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180079:12"/> ſurrounded with ſtately Walks of Platan's, and other ſhady Trees, built round with Xyſti, Portico's, finely paved with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly coloured and far-fetch'd Marble, laid in artificial Figures, noble Ranges of Pillars, adorned within with Fiſh-Ponds, Aviaries, Fountains and Statues. Such ſtill are the Villa's of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes at <hi>Fraſcati, Tivoli,</hi> and their other delicious Seats in <hi>Latium</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania,</hi> ſo celebrated of old, for being the Gardens of the <hi>Europaean</hi> World. Such, in ſome meaſure, are the famous Gardens about <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> where Shade and Coolneſs give them their greateſt Pleaſure, in a Region where the Soil naturally furniſhes its Inhabitants with excellent Fruit, and fragrant Flowers; ſo that they are at little pains to cultivate that which they can have without, and which would not afford half that Delight in their Gardens of Pleaſure, that they find in lying, in the cool of the Day, under a ſhady <hi>Plane,</hi> by a Fountain-ſide. This made the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, who all lived in warm Climates, admire the <hi>Plane</hi> ſo exceedingly, that frantic Stories are told of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s doting upon one in the <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> when he was bringing down his mighty Armies againſt <hi>Greece</hi> 
                        <note n="(s)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Aelian. Var. Hiſt.</hi> 2. 14.</note>. The Walks of <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> and the Gardens of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:180079:13"/> of this ſort, Cool and Delicious; but which can give us no Idea of the Artificial Beauties of Modern Gardens. For the Queſtion is not, which is in it ſelf plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanter; or, whether if we lived in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Perſia,</hi> we ſhould not rather chuſe to imitate the Faſhion of thoſe Countries: but, which ſhews the greateſt Skill of him that makes it.</p>
                     <p>The Gardens of this Age are of ſeveral ſorts, <hi>for the Kitchen, for Flowers, for Greens,</hi> and <hi>Shady Walks, for Fruit-Trees,</hi> and <hi>for the Apothecary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the Firſt of theſe, the Induſtry of the Ancients (as we have ſeen already) was in a manner wholly confined. That they knew how to manage thoſe Kitchen Stores which their Gardens yielded, is unqueſtionable; but their Variety was not near ſo great, ſince neither was the New World known, nor the Old ſo well examined as it has been ſince. Beſides, they knew little of the Art of Raiſing Summer Plants, in the ſevereſt Froſts, and ſo making all Seaſons of the Year unite in one, at Great Men's Tables; the bringing which to the preſent Perfection, is due to the Induſtry and Sagacity of the Age we live in; which how much it has enlarged this part of Gardening from what it was anciently, every Man by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180079:13"/> himſelf will eaſily imagine. The <hi>Romans,</hi> indeed, had a way of Preſerving Melons in Winter, by Sowing them in a large Box fill'd with rich Mold and Dung, which they houſed in Winter, and expoſed in Sun-ſhiny Days under their <hi>Specularia,</hi> that ſeem to have been of the nature of our Glaſſes: by which Contrivance, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> the Emperor had Melons all the Year round. That ſhews what Neceſſity might have forced them to, had they been put to it.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Flower Gardens,</hi> the Ancients minded them not. They require an open Sun, and a free Air, which in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries would have been Nuiſanſes, rather than Delights. Plants remarkable for their Beauty or their Smell, had a place indeed in their Plantations; but we find no mention of any great Variety of Species, or Art in Ranging or Managing thoſe they had. There is nothing ſaid in any <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Authors of large Gravel-Walks, ſurrounding ſpacious Graſs-Plats, edged with beautiful Borders, fill'd with all that choice of Auricula's, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipa's, Carnations, Tuberoſes, Jonquilles, Lily's, Hyacinths, Narciſſus's, and that almoſt infinite diverſity of Beautiful and Odoriferous Flowers that now adorn our <hi>Gardens.</hi> They knew not the Art of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180079:14"/> the Colours, Enlarging the Flowers, and giving them all thoſe ſickly or luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant Beauties which are ſo commonly to be met with in our Gardens. Some Notion they had of Managing <hi>Dwarf-Trees,</hi> and Clipping other Trees that would bear it into what Form the Gardeners pleaſe; but they ſpeak ſo little of it, that we have no reaſon to think they underſtood much of that beautiful Furniture which <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Ever-greens</hi> afford us.</p>
                     <p>The Uſefulneſs of <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> made them be anciently more regarded. The Vines and Olives of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> we have mention'd alteady. They had ſeveral ſorts of Apples, Pears, Quinces, Peaches, Pomegranates, Plums, Figs and Nuts: As for Oranges and Limons, and the delicious Fruits of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> they were wholly Strangers to them. And they had not near the Variety of thoſe they knew, with which Monſieur <hi>de la Quintinie,</hi> were they now alive, cou'd furniſh them. Though they had many Precepts concerning Pruning, Setting, Graffing and Inoculating, knew their Uſefulneſs, and cou'd perform all thoſe Operations with Succeſs; yet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking, their Manner was courſe; and had their Climates been as unkindly, their Succeſs wou'd have been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180079:14"/> but indifferent. They could manage Earth and Air and Water pretty tolerably; but how to bring the Sun under Rules (if I may uſe ſo bold an Expreſſion) they knew not; which yet, by their Wall-Plantations, our Gardeners do every day. That is an Invention the Ancients were entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with; thereby, in Cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, we can command the Warmth of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and have Fruits of a Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Colour, and Taſte, which ev'n at Home they can ſcarce reach.</p>
                     <p>It will not be hard now, with due Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances, to make a juſt Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Ancient and Modern Horticulture.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de la Quintinie</hi> will give us a full and juſt Idea of what the Skill of this Age can reach to: Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi>'s <hi>Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darium Hortenſe</hi> ought to be joined with it, to ſhew the Difference in a more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Clime. What Variety our Floriſts can pretend to, will appear from <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe, Ferrarius</hi>'s <hi>Flora,</hi> or <hi>Swertius</hi>'s <hi>Florilegium.</hi> In thoſe Books one may ſee what Art can do, to beautifie and enlarge Flowers beyond what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ordinarily produces. Other Men can only <hi>follow</hi> Nature; the Gardener alone <hi>leads</hi> it, and haſtens or ſlackens its pace according as ſuits beſt with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns or Inclinations.</p>

                        <p>SURGERY comes next to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; which though at preſent it be look'd upon as inferior to PHYSIC, yet it was much the ancienteſt, and is ſtill the certaineſt part of <hi>Medicine.</hi> For here the Eye directs the <hi>Surgeon</hi> how he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and if he knows but the Virtue of his Medicines, and how to apply them, he can, generally ſpeaking, tell whether his Patient be curable or not. Anciently this was only a Branch of the <hi>Phyſician</hi>'s Work; and the Old <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in the Heroical Times, <hi>Aeſculapius, Chiron, Machaon,</hi> and the reſt, were little more than <hi>Surgeons</hi> that could apply a Plaiſter, and cure a Green Wound. Nay, after Learning had emboldened Men to reaſon upon the Cauſes of Diſeaſes whoſe Original was not viſible to the naked Eye, and to try whether Inward Remedies would not cure them; <hi>Surgery</hi> was conſtantly treated of by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,</hi>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:180079:15"/> as a part of their Profeſſion. <hi>Celſus</hi> alone will convince every Man of the truth of this Propoſition.</p>
                        <p>But how they treated of it, I durſt not adventure to aſſert; tho' the Public will thank me for leaving it untouch'd, ſince that eminently Learned Surgeon, Mr. <hi>Charles Bernard,</hi> who is ſo great an Honour to his Profeſſion, has done me the favour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this following Paper: which I ſhall ſubjoin in his own words:</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>If we enquire into the Improvements which have been made by the Moderns in <hi>Surgery,</hi> we ſhall be forced to confeſs, that we have ſo little reaſon to value our ſelves beyond the Ancients, or to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to contemn them, as the faſhion is among thoſe who know little, and have read nothing, that we cannot give ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or more convincing Proofs of our own Ignorance, as well as our Pride. I do not pretend that the Moderns have not at all contributed towards the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of <hi>Surgery;</hi> that were both abſurd and injurious, and would argue as much folly as that which I am reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but that which I am conteſting for, is, That it conſiſts rather in Refining and Dreſſing up the Inventions of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and ſetting them in a better Light,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180079:16"/> than in Adding many important ones of our own. Whether it be, that the Art of Healing External Hurts, being princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the Subject of our Senſes, was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ſtudied, and therefore capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſooner brought to a greater degree of Perfection, than the other branch of Medicine; or, that the majority of the meer Profeſſors having been for ſome Ages illiterate and empirical, it hath not been advanc'd and cultivated ſo as it might have been, had they been better qualify'd than they generally were, and do yet, for the greateſt part, continue to be: For a Teſtimony of which, that exceeding Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of good Writers which occurr in <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi> when compar'd with thoſe in moſt of the other learned Arts and Sciences, is, in my opinion, ſufficient; and yet, were they fewer, 'twould, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe <hi>Scioli,</hi> be no great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Art. For the Folly of which Aſſertion, the beſt Excuſe that can be made, ſeems to be, that becauſe ſome Methods of proceeding both in <hi>Phyſic</hi> and <hi>Surgery,</hi> which are incommunicable, to which every Man muſt be directed by his own Judgment and Natural Sagacity, not being to be found in thoſe Authors whom theſe opinionated Practitioners have had the luck to conſult, they are led imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180079:16"/> to deſpiſe all Reading, as uſeleſs and uninſtructive; eſpecially that of the Ancients, who do not generally, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, write to Novitiates and Fools, or to thoſe who will be always ſuch.</p>
                           <p>But whoever hath been converſant in their Writings, and hath the Opportunity and Capacity of comparing and judging from his own Experience, will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that one thing which does not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle recommend the Reading of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond moſt of the Moderns, is, That they are more accurate in deſcribing the <hi>Pathog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomonics,</hi> and more juſt and nice in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the Species of Tumors and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, than our more refined Moderns are.</p>
                           <p>If this Age hath par'd away any rude and ſuperfluous Methods of Practice, as it muſt be confeſs'd they have, it cannot be demonſtrated that they were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the Ancients, but were in a great meaſure introduc'd by ignorant and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Profeſſors of a much later date.</p>
                           <p>There is no queſtion, but that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Improvements which have theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages been made in <hi>Surgery,</hi> are owing chiefly to the Diſcoveries which have been made in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> by which we are better enabled to ſolve many of thoſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which were before inexplicable, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained amiſs; the moſt important part,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180079:17"/> in the mean while (I mean the Art of Healing, to which all the others ought to be ſubſervient) remaining very little better than the Ancients left it.</p>
                           <p>As an unconteſtable Proof of what I ſay, I appeal to all thoſe Bodies of <hi>Surgery</hi> which have been hitherto publiſh'd by the moſt Learned and Celebrated of the Moderns, being all manifeſtly Tranſcripts from one another, and the beſt of them from the Ancients. But this may indeed be ſaid in defence of the Moderns in this particular, That even Tranſcribing is not their Invention, tho' it be their Practice; for <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Aegineta</hi> have borrow'd not a little of what they have, from <hi>Galen;</hi> and <hi>Marcellus Empiricus</hi> more groſly from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonius Largus,</hi> without ſo much as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his Name among the reſt of thoſe Authors to whom he was leſs beholden.</p>
                           <p>Among all the Syſtematical Writers, I think there are very few who refuſe the Preference to <hi>Hieron. Fabricius ab Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendente,</hi> as a Perſon of unqueſtion'd Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Judgment; and yet is not be aſham'd to let his Readers know, that <hi>Celſus</hi> among the Latins (who, he tells us, is <hi>Mirabilis in Omnibus,</hi> and adviſes, in <hi>Horace</hi>'s words, <hi>Nocturnâ verſare manu, verſare diurnâ,) Paulus Aegineta</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Albuchaſis</hi> among the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180079:17"/> 
                              <hi>Arabians</hi> (whom I am unwilling to place among the Moderns, being in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe whom our Modern Judges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, either becauſe they never read him, or becauſe he had the misfortune to live DC Years ſince) are the Triumvirate to whom he principally ſtands indebted, for the Aſſiſtance he received from them, in compoſing his excellent Book.</p>
                           <p>But how many Operations are there now in uſe, which were unknown to the Ancients? I fear, that upon a due En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, there wou'd be more uſeful ones found to be omitted or diſcontinued, than to have been invented by us. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend a little to Particulars, that we may, without Prejudice or Partiality, be enabled to determine whether the Ancients are indeed ſo contemptible, and their Writings ſo uſeleſs, as ſome would repreſent them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Cutting for the Stone</hi> (to begin with that) was unqueſtionably theirs, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accurately deſcribed by <hi>Celſus</hi> and others; and yet that no Perſon or Age may be defrauded of the Glory they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, where we can do them right, we muſt confeſs, that that way of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, which in moſt caſes is preferrible, and in ſome only practicable, which by Authors is ſtyl'd <hi>Magnus Apparatus,</hi> the High Operation, or <hi>Cutting upon the Staff,</hi>
                              <pb n="32" facs="tcp:180079:18"/> was invented by one <hi>Joannes de Romanis</hi> of <hi>Cremona,</hi> who flouriſh'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> about the Year 1520. The Manner of the Operation, and the Inſtruments neceſſary, were firſt deſcribed and publiſh'd by his Scholar <hi>Marianus Sanctus Barolitanus,</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> in 1535. The Uſe of the <hi>Modiolus,</hi> in Opening the Skull, was likewiſe theirs; our Country-man <hi>Woodall</hi> only mending the Inſtrument, by making that Taper, which was before Cylindrical, and for that reaſon not altogether ſo ſecure: The <hi>Alae,</hi> or Wings, being the Invention of that Great Man <hi>Aquapendens,</hi> to whom we ſtand obliged for many other uſeful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. The <hi>Paracenteſis,</hi> in all its kinds, is theirs: <hi>Barbette,</hi> indeed, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Inſtrument which is ſometimes more commodiouſly made uſe of than the Ancient Methods are. <hi>Laryngotomy,</hi> or the <hi>Opening of the Wind-Pipe,</hi> in a Quinſey, was practis'd by them; an Operation ſecure and neceſſary; however, at this day ſo diſus'd, that it is almoſt become obſolete, either through the Timidity of the Patient, or Relations, or the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs or Ignorance of the Phyſician or Surgeon; and tho' <hi>Aretaeus, P. Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi> and <hi>Caelius Aurelianus,</hi> ſeem, from the Authority of <hi>Antyllus,</hi> to diſcourſe doubtfully of it; yet the greateſt part
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180079:18"/> of the Ancients, both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> adviſe it; and <hi>Galen</hi> in particular, from Reaſon and Experience, as well as from the Authority of <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> juſtly recommends it as the laſt Refuge in a Quinſey. <hi>Cutting for the Hernia Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> with the true Diſtinctions and Cures of all the other Species, are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deſcribed by them. They taught us the Cure of the <hi>Pterigion</hi> and <hi>Cataract;</hi> they deſcribed and diſtinguiſh'd all the Diſeaſes of the Eyes, (which were not then, as now to the reproach of the Age they are, almoſt ſolely in the Hands of Old Women and Mountebanks) as juſtly as any of our Modern Oculiſts, who, indeed, do little more than tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe from them. <hi>Opening an Artery,</hi> and the <hi>Jugular-Vein,</hi> (pretended to be revived here in <hi>England)</hi> was no more firſt attempted by the Moderns, than making <hi>Ligature</hi> in an <hi>Aneuriſm;</hi> which though an Operation of no mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, was certainly not underſtood, very lately, by <hi>Fred. Ruyſch,</hi> a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Dutch Anatomiſt,</hi> and Profeſſor of that and Surgery at <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> [as may be ſeen in his <hi>Obſervationes Anatomico-Chirurgicae,</hi> Obſ. 2. printed in <hi>Quarto,</hi> at <hi>Amſtel.</hi> 1691.] The <hi>Extirpation of the Tonſils,</hi> or <hi>Uvula,</hi> is not our Invention;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180079:19"/> though, indeed, the removal of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by <hi>Potential Cauteries,</hi> which we ſometimes uſe, when the Patient will not admit Exciſion or Fire, ſeems neither to have been practis'd nor known to the Ancients. The manner of treating the <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymalis</hi> (a nice and difficult Cure, very often) which we continue at this day, is no other than what was taught by them; only the Uſe of the <hi>Cannula</hi> for the <hi>Cautery</hi> ſeems owing to <hi>Fabr. ab Aquapendente.</hi> As for the <hi>Actual Cautery,</hi> no inconſiderable, however terrible a branch of <hi>Surgery</hi> it may ſeem, though <hi>Coſtaeus, Fienus</hi> and <hi>Severinus</hi> have written ſo amply concerning it; yet from one ſingle Aphoriſm 'tis demonſtrable, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> knew its true Uſe as well as any that have ſince ſucceeded him; not to mention how frequent it is in the Writings of all the reſt of the Ancients, and us'd in many caſes (I don't doubt but with admirable ſucceſs) wherein it is wholly neglected, or not underſtood by us. The Cure of the <hi>Varices,</hi> by Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſcarce talk'd of in our days, ſeems to have been familiarly practis'd among the Ancients, as is manifeſt from <hi>Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Aegineta;</hi> though ſo painful an Operation, that, as <hi>Tully</hi> [2 <hi>Tuſcul.]</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> tell us, <hi>Marius</hi> was the firſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180079:19"/> who in one Leg underwent it, ſtanding, and without being bound, though he cou'd not be prevail'd upon to purchaſe with ſo much Torture a Cure in the other: And though <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that he was <hi>unus Hominum,</hi> the ſingle Inſtance; yet <hi>Tully</hi> aſſures us, that by his Example, there were others that ſuſtain'd with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Reſolution and Fortitude. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is converſant with thoſe obſtinate Varicous Ulcers which we frequently meet with, will confeſs, that for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of a Cure, 'tis abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, however painful and ſuperfluous an Operation ſome may eſteem it. The Ancients mention the <hi>Vari</hi> and <hi>Valgi,</hi> and preſcribe us a Method of Cure; but the manner of their Reduction by the Inſtruments now in uſe they knew not, which were the Invention of <hi>Fabricius ab Aquapendente:</hi> as was alſo that for <hi>Extraction of the Polypus;</hi> which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Ancients cur'd as frequently, tho' not ſo commodiouſly as our ſelves. But the <hi>Polypus of the Ear</hi> (a Diſeaſe indeed which occurrs not ſo often as the preceding) ſeems ſo little known to the Moderns, that the very Mention of any ſuch Diſeaſe is rarely to be met with in any of their Writings, yet the Cure of it is not omitted by the Ancients. They
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180079:20"/> were perfectly acquainted and furniſh'd with Convenient Inſtruments for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all the Species of <hi>Fractures</hi> and <hi>Luxations,</hi> and the Methods of treating them afterwards; together with all the kinds of <hi>Sutures</hi> at this day in uſe among us, and ſome too that are now loſt, at leaſt ſo uncertain, that ſome very learned Men have thought they employed not their time amiſs, in endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what they were, and to recover their Uſe. And though ſome have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that <hi>Iſſues</hi> were unknown to them, the contrary is evident from <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Caelius Aurelianus;</hi> though we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the placing and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing them as now we do, appears not to have been in uſe among them. Nor is the <hi>Seton</hi> ſo extremely Modern, but that <hi>Lanfrancus,</hi> who liv'd CCCC Years ſince, directs its Uſe, and deſcribes the manner of Making, (yet mentions it not as an Invention of his time,) though indeed, till <hi>Hildanus</hi>'s days, it ſeems to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made with the <hi>Actual Cautery.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is no doubt but the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180079:20"/> which ought to provoke the Emulation of our Profeſſors here) is owing purely to the Felicity of the Moderns of the laſt Century. For, not to enter into the Controverſie, whether <hi>Pliny, Nonius</hi> or <hi>Iſidore</hi> were in the right, in aſſerting, that the Firſt of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> was denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from his manner of Birth; or <hi>Probus</hi> and <hi>Feſtus,</hi> in affirming, that they were the <hi>Caeſones;</hi> whereas the <hi>Caeſars</hi> were only ſo called, from their Hair: Moſt certain it is, that neither Side pretend the Operation to have been done <hi>Matre Superſtite:</hi> Nor is there any Evidence, that Cutting the <hi>Foetus</hi> out of the Womb, and Preſerving the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was ever propos'd or thought of by the Ancients, whether <hi>Greek, Latine</hi> or <hi>Arabian;</hi> both the Story, and the Reaſon of the Name, being to be found only in the Hiſtorians and Grammarians.

                              <hi>the Hair-Lip,</hi> or the like; for that they knew and practis'd; and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to do right to the Age whoſe it was, for the Diſcovery of that which <hi>Gaſpar Taliacotius</hi> properly ſo calls, and which himſelf brought to Perfection, and (whatever Scruples ſome who have not examin'd the Hiſtory, may entertain concerning either the Truth or Poſſibility of the Fact) practis'd with wonderful Dexterity and Succeſs, as may be prov'd from Authorities not to be conteſted. So that it is a moſt ſurpriſing thing to conſider, that few or none ſhould have ſince attempted to imitate ſo worthy and excellent a Pattern, eſpecially in an Age wherein ſo many deplorable and ſcandalous Objects do every day ſeem either to beg or command our Aſſiſtance. But I do not aſſert him to have been the firſt Inventor, becauſe it is what I find mention'd, tho' imperfectly, by <hi>Alex.

                           <p>And tho' the Variety of <hi>Inſtruments</hi> now in uſe, may ſeem, in ſome meaſure,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:180079:22"/> to be juſtly challeng'd by the Moderns, every Man adding as his own Fancy ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and the Neceſſity required; yet by what are tranſmitted to us by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, 'tis notorious, that they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant nor deſtitute of thoſe which were moſt neceſſary; and that they had Variety of others too, may, by what we ſee deſcrib'd by <hi>Oribaſius</hi> and others, and are at this day made uſe of, more eaſily be imagin'd than prov'd, but ſeems high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable.</p>
                           <p>As for <hi>Topical Medicines,</hi> moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that we are oblig'd to them, for inſtructing us in the Nature and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of almoſt all thoſe of which we do at this day form our Applications; ſome few excepted, the Productions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Chymiſtry, in this or the preceding Century.</p>
                           <p>And as for general Methods of Cure, many of them have been ſo excellently well handled by the Ancients, (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in Wounds of the Head) that ſeveral of the Moderns who have written moſt judiciouſly upon them, have been of Opinion, that they could not ſerve and oblige Poſterity better, than by Commenting upon that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Book of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> upon the ſame Subject.</p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:180079:23"/>
                           <p> That which without Injury to the Ancients, or Vanity in our Selves, may be juſtly ſaid, is, That the publiſhing Obſervations after that Method which ſome of the Moderns have done, is that wherein we muſt be allowed infinitely to have exceeded them; and is vaſtly of more Advantage to the Reader, than the peruſal of tedious Syſtems are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being, two or three of which generally comprehending whatever is to be found in all the reſt: But particular Caſes, when judiciouſly and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, (of which, too few, I fear, even of the Moderns are guilty,) <hi>Et prodeſſe ſolent &amp; delectare,</hi> are diverting and inſtructive at once, the Reader more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually adding other Men's Experience to his own.</p>
                           <p>But to inſiſt upon every Particular, and to pretend to demonſtrate what hath been Invented, Diſcontinued or Loſt in every Age, if it be to be done, requires a Perſon of greater Leiſure, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more capable than my ſelf. What I have ſaid, is ſufficient to ſhew, that it becomes us to ſpeak of the Ancients with Reſpect and Civility at leaſt, if it were only for this; That it was our Inſtruction, and the Benefit of Mankind in general, which induc'd them to take
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180079:23"/> that Care, and to be at ſo much Expence of Time and Labour to communicate their Knowledge to the World: Not that we are implicitly to be be determin'd by their Authority, or to ſuppoſe that they have not left room for ſucceeding Ages to Invent, and to Improve all thoſe Parts of <hi>Surgery</hi> wherein they appear either to have been miſtaken or dificient. For my own part, I muſt confeſs, I do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely concurr with <hi>Thomas Bartholine, [Epiſt.

                     <p>SInce the <hi>Second Edition</hi> of my Book was printed off, we have had an Account in the <hi>Journal des Sçavans,</hi> that Monſieur <hi>Perrault</hi> has publiſh'd a THIRD PART of his <hi>Parallel between the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and the Moderns;</hi> in which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove, that the Skill of the Moderns in <hi>Geography, Philoſophy, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, Mathematics, Navigation,</hi> &amp;c. is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible to that of the Ancients. The Book is not yet, that I know of, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and poſſibly may not be procurable in ſome time. I thought it neceſſary, however, to take notice, that I have had a bare Intimation of ſuch a Book, and no more; that ſo if in any Material Things we ſhould happen to Agree, (as writing upon the ſame Argument, 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 220. I have, upon his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given <hi>Columbus</hi> the Credit of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering that little Bone in the Inner Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Ear, which, from its figure, is commonly call'd the <hi>Stirrup:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he being the firſt that ever men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd it in Print, and pretending that it was his own Invention, ſeems to have the faireſt Plea to the Honour of it. But <hi>Philippus Ingraſſias,</hi> who wrote ſome time before <hi>Columbus,</hi> certainly knew it: For, in his Commentary upon <hi>Galen de Oſſibus,</hi> he expreſsly mentions it; and for that Reaſon, <hi>Falloppius,</hi> who could not want Opportunity of being truly inform'd, and was a right honeſt Man, and a judicious Anatomiſt, and one to whom many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries are owing, aſcribes it to him in ſuch Terms as put the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond diſpute. <hi>Tertium</hi> (ſays <hi>Falloppius,</hi> ſpeaking of the little Bones in the Inner Cavity of the Ear) <hi>ſi nolumus debitâ laude quenquam defraudare, invenit &amp; promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavit primus Johannes Philippus ab Ingraſſia Siculus Philoſophus ac Medicus Doctiſſimus</hi>

                     <p>Some, perhaps, will think this Enquiry into the Author of this Diſcovery, to be a needleſs Affectation of Exactneſs. But 'tis ſo much the Duty of all Writers, not to miſ-lead their Readers in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt particular, that they are obliged to rectifie their own Miſtakes where-ever they find them, and not to be afraid of being accuſed of Negligence; ſince Truth, and not Glory, ought to be the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End of all our Labours and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
                     <p>I am obliged alſo to take notice, that I have lately got a ſight of <hi>Servetus</hi>'s <hi>Chriſtianiſmi Reſtitutio,</hi> out of which that famous paſſage concerning the <hi>Circulation</hi>

                        <hi>of the Blood,</hi> which I ſet down at length, <hi>pag.</hi> 230. was copied long ago by that worthy Member of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> Mr. <hi>Abraham Hill,</hi> from whom Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> had it. My Lord Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> whoſe incomparable Library con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains every thing that is rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, did me the Honour to ſhow it me. His Manuſcript Copy is a Tranſcript of that Printed one which is preſerved in the Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe</hi>'s Library at <hi>Caſſels;</hi> the very Book that was peruſed by <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> who gives an Account of it in his <hi>Bibliotheca Antitrinitariorum.</hi> The Book it ſelf was printed (at <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſays <hi>Sandius)</hi> in 1553. and is a Collection of all <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus</hi>'s <hi>Theological Tracts,</hi> though conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably enlarged: ſome of which, and particularly his <hi>Diſcourſes concerning the Trinity,</hi> had been publiſh'd Twenty Years before. This I mention; becauſe, if what <hi>Servetus</hi> ſays of the Paſſage of the Blood through the Lungs, be in the former Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Diſcovery has ſo much the greater Antiquity.

It is a <hi>ſubtile</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (ſo I render <hi>tenuis</hi> here) wrought by the force of Heat; of a florid Colour, having the power of Fire: ſo that it is a ſort of ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180079:27"/> Vapour made of the purer part of the Blood, containing within it ſelf the ſubſtance of Water, Air and Fire. It is made in the Lungs, by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Inſpired Air with that Elaborated Subtile Blood which the Right Ventricle of the Heart communicates to the Left. Now this Communication is not made through the <hi>Septum</hi> of the Heart, as is commonly believed, but the ſubtile Blood is very artificially agitated by a long paſſage through the Lungs from the right Ventricle of the Heart, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, made florid by the Lungs, and transfuſed out of the <hi>Arterious Vein</hi> into the <hi>Venous Artery,</hi> and at laſt in the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Artery</hi> it ſelf it is mixed with the Inſpired Air, and by expiration purged from its Dregs. And thus at length the whole Mixture is attracted, by the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole</hi> of the Heart, into the left Ventricle, being now a fit Subſtance out of which to form the Vital Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Now that this Communication and Preparation is made by the Lungs, is evident from the various Conjunction and Communication of the <hi>Arterious Vein</hi> with the <hi>Venous Artery</hi> in the Lungs; the remarkable largeneſs of the <hi>Arterious Vein</hi> does likewiſe confirm it: ſince it

                     <p>If we compare now this Notion thus explained by <hi>Servetus,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s <hi>Theory of the Circulation of the Blood,</hi> we ſhall plainly ſee, that he had imperfect Glimmerings of that Light which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> communicated with ſo bright a Luſtre to the learned World: Which Glimmerings, ſince they were ſo true, having nothing in them of a Falſe-Fire, I much wonder that he went no further; though at the ſame time I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but heartily congratulate the Felicity of my own Countrey, which produced
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180079:28"/> the Man that firſt ſaw the Importance of theſe noble Hints which he improved into a <hi>Theory,</hi> and thereby made them truly uſeful to Mankind.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude this POSTSCRIPT, it will be expected, perhaps, that I ſhould ſay ſomething concerning this <hi>New Edition.</hi> I have taken the Liberty which all Men have ever allowed, to Alter and Add where I thought any thing was faulty or deficient, and now and then I omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome few Paſſages that did not ſo immediately relate to the deſign of the Book.</p>
                     <p>By one of theſe <hi>Additions,</hi> that of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> put in at my requeſt, it will be yet further ſeen, that I would have nothing allowed to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, where the Cauſe will not ſtrictly bear it. I had conceded ſo much to them before, that it was generally thought I was biaſs'd on their behalf: It was not enough, to tell the World I was of no Side; the contrary was taken for granted, ſince in ſo many Particulars I actually gave them the Pre-eminence, when Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> had given it them almoſt in nothing. I muſt own, I was glad it could be proved, that the World has not actually loſt its
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:180079:29"/> Vigour, but that a gradual Improvement is plainly viſible; which this Inſtance that Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> has ſo inconteſtably made out, does by no means contradict. For <hi>Surgery,</hi> though it is the certaineſt, yet it is the ſimpleſt part of <hi>Medicine:</hi> There the Operator is more let into his Work, which does not depend ſo much upon Conjecture as <hi>Phyſic.</hi> The Reproach therefore of its comparatively ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, is to be laid upon the <hi>Men,</hi> not the <hi>Art;</hi> it has been for theſe laſt Ages eſteemed too Mechanical for Men of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Education, and fine Parts, to buſie themſelves about: So that I queſtion not but if as many learned Men had cultivated <hi>Surgery</hi> for theſe laſt CCC Years, as have employed themſelves in ſome other Parts of Natural and Mathematical Learning, it would have met with as proportionable an Encreaſe; unleſs we ſhould ſay, that it is already come to its higheſt Perfection; which, whether it be or no, I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to decide.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>entire</hi> Diſcourſes which are added, are printed by themſelves, for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thoſe who have bought the <hi>Firſt Edition,</hi> and have no Curioſity to compare that with the <hi>Second.</hi> But I have not re-printed thoſe <hi>leſſer</hi> Additions which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:180079:29"/> are interwoven into the Body of the Book, both becauſe they would appear only like a parcel of looſe Scraps, and becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be done in compliance to the Bookſeller, who (having once more, at a time when Printing labours under ſo great Diſcouragements, adventur'd to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſo large a Book which ſo few People will care to read) deſired that this <hi>Second Edition</hi> might be made as Valuable to him as well it cou'd.</p>

                  <p>IT may perhaps be further affirmed, in favour of the Ancients; That the oldeſt Books we have, are ſtill in their kind the beſt. The two moſt Ancient that I know of in Proſe, among thoſe we call Profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, are <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fables, and <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epiſtles, both living near the ſame time, which was that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> As the firſt has been agreed by all Ages ſince for the greateſt Maſter in his kind; and all others of that ſort have been but Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Original: ſo I think the Epiſtles of <hi>Phalaris</hi> to have more Race, more Spirit, more Force of Wit and Genius, than any others I have ever ſeen either Ancient or Modern. I know, ſeveral Learned Men (or that uſually paſs for ſuch, under the Name of Critics) have not eſteemed them Genuine; and <hi>Politian,</hi> with ſome others, have attributed them to <hi>Lucian:</hi> but I think he muſt have little Skill in Painting, that cannot find out this to be an Original. Such Diverſity of Paſſions, upon ſuch Variety of Actions and Paſſages of Life and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſuch Freedom of Thought, ſuch Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180079:32"/> of Expreſſion; ſuch Bounty to his Friends, ſuch Scorn of his Enemies; ſuch Honour of Learned Men, ſuch Eſteem of Good; ſuch Knowledge of Life, ſuch Contempt of Death; with ſuch Fierceneſs of Nature, and Cruelty of Revenge, could never be repreſented but by him that poſſeſſed them. And I eſteem <hi>Lucian</hi> to have been no more capable of Writing, than of Acting what <hi>Phalaris</hi> did. In all One writ, you find the Scholar or the Sophiſt; and all, the Other, the Tyrant and the Commander.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Remember, that diſcourſing with you upon this Paſſage of Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> (which I have here ſet down,) I happen'd to ſay, That with all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſo great an Authority, and under a juſt Awe of ſo ſharp a Cenſure, I believed it might be even demonſtrated, that the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Phalaris</hi> are Spurious,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180079:33"/> and that we have nothing now extant of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s own Compoſing. This caſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of my Opinion, by the power of that long Friendſhip that has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, you improved into a Promiſe, That I would ſend you my Reaſons in Writing, to be added to the New Edition of your Book: believing it, as I ſuppoſe, a conſiderable Point in the Controverſie you are engaged in. For if it once be made out, that thoſe Writings your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſo extolls, are Suppoſititious, and of no very long Standing; you have then His and his Parties own Confeſſion, That ſome of the Later Pens have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the Old ones in thier kinds: And to others, that have but a mean Eſteem of the Wit and Stile of thoſe Books, it will be a double Prejudice againſt him, in your favour, That he could neither diſcover the true Time, nor the true Value of his Authors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, I imagine, were your Thoughts; when you engaged me to this, that I am now doing. But I muſt take the freedom to profeſs, that I write without any view or regard to your Controverſie; which I do not make my own, nor preſume to interpoſe in it. 'Tis a Subject ſo nice and delicate, and of ſuch a mixed and diffuſed nature, that I am content to make the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180079:33"/> beſt Uſe I can of both Ancients and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, without venturing with you, upon the hazard of a wrong Compariſon, or the envy of a true one.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>ſome of the Oldeſt Books are the beſt in their kinds,</hi> the ſame Perſon having the double Glory of Invention and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; is a thing obſerved even by ſome of the Ancients <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Dion. Chryſoſt.</hi> Orat. 33. p. 397.</note>. But then the Authors they gave this Honour to, are <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Archilochus,</hi> one the Father of Heroic Poem, and the other of Epode and Trochaic. But the choice of <hi>Phalaris</hi> and <hi>Aeſop,</hi> as they are now extant, for the two great inimitable Originals, is a piece of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm of a peculiar Complexion, and muſt proceed from a Singularity of Palate and Judgment.</p>
                  <p>To paſs a Cenſure upon all kinds of Writings, to ſhew their ſeveral Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and Defects, and eſpecially to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign each of them to their proper Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, was the chief Province and the greateſt Commendation of the Ancient Critics. And it appears from thoſe Remains of Antiquity that are left us, that they never wanted Employment. For to forge and counterfeit Books, and father them upon Great Names, has been a Practice almoſt as old as Letters. But it was then moſt of all in faſhion, when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180079:34"/> the <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Galen. in Hippoc. de Natura Hominis,</hi> Comm. 2. p. 17. Ed. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
                     </note> Kings of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> rivalling one another in the Magnificence and Copiouſneſs of their Libraries, gave great rates for any Treatiſes that carried the names of celebrated Authors. Which was an Invitation to the Scribes and Copyers of thoſe Times, to enhance the Price of their Wares by aſcribing them to Men of Fame and Reputation; and to ſuppreſs the true Names, that would have yielded leſs Money. And now and then even an Author, that wrote for Bread, and made a Traffic of his Labours, would purpoſely conceal himſelf, and perſonate ſome old Writer of eminent Note; giving the Title and Credit of his Works to the Dead, that himſelf might the better live by them. But what was then done chiefly for Lucre, was afterwards done out of Glory and Affectation, as an Exerciſe of Stile, and an Oſtentation of Wit. In this the Tribe of the Sophiſts are principally concerned; in whoſe Schools it was the ordinary task to compoſe <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180079:34"/> in the Names of <hi>Penelope</hi> and the reſt. 'Tis true, they came abroad under his own Name; becauſe they were written in <hi>Latin</hi> and in Verſe, and ſo had no colour or pretence to be the Originals of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Ladies. But ſome of the <hi>Greek</hi> Sophiſts had the Succeſs and Satisfaction to ſee their Eſſays in that kind paſs with ſome Readers for the genuine Works of thoſe they endeavoured to expreſs. This, no doubt, was great Content and Joy to them; being as full a Teſtimony of their Skill in Imitation; as the Birds gave to the Painter, when they peck'd at his Grapes.

And to ſpeak freely, the greateſt part of Mankind are ſo eaſily impoſed on in this way, that there is too great Invitation to put the trick upon them. What clumſie Cheats, thoſe <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles now extant, and <hi>Ariſteas</hi>'s Story of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> paſſed without controul even among very learned Men.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180079:35"/> And even ſome Modern Attempts of this kind have met with Succeſs not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcouraging. For though <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> after a Reputation of ſome Years, and <hi>Inghiramius</hi> immediately, were ſhamed out of all Credit: yet <hi>Sigonius</hi>'s Eſſay <hi>de Conſolatione,</hi> as coming from a skilful Hand, may perhaps paſs for <hi>Cicero</hi>'s with ſome, as long as <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf ſhall laſt.

                     <p>THat Sophiſt, whoever he was, that wrote a ſmall Book of Letters in the Name and Character of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> (give me leave to ſay this now, which I ſhall prove by and by) had not ſo bad a hand at Humouring and Perſonating, but that ſeveral believed, it was the Tyrant himſelf that talked ſo big, and could not diſcover the Aſs under the Skin of that Lion.

And <hi>Johannes Tzetzes,</hi> a Man of much rambling Learning, has many and large Extracts out of them, in his <hi>Chiliads;</hi> aſcribing them all to the Tyrant whoſe Livery they wear. Theſe three, I think, are the only Men among the Ancients, that make any mention of them: but ſince they give not the leaſt hint of any Doubts concerning their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; we may conclude, that all the

And I ſhall not go to diſpoſſeſs him, as thoſe have done before me, by an Arbitrary Sentence in his own Tyrannical Way; but proceed with him upon lawful Evidence, and a fair, impartial Trial. And I am very much miſtaken in the Nature and Force of my Proofs, if ever any Man hereafter, that reads them, perſiſt in his old Opinion of making <hi>Phalaris</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                     <p>The Cenſures that are made from Stile and Language alone, are commonly nice and uncertain, and depend upon ſlender Notices. Some very ſagacious and learned Men have been deceived in thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, even to ridicule. The great <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> publiſhed a few Iambics, as a choice Fragment of an old Tragedian, given him by <hi>Muretus;</hi> who ſoon after confeſs'd the Jeſt, that they were made by himſelf. <hi>Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornius</hi> writ a Commentary upon a ſmall Poem <hi>De Lite,</hi> ſuppoſed by him to be ſome
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180079:37"/> ancient Author's; but it was ſoon diſcover'd to be <hi>Michael Hoſpitalius</hi>'s, a late Chancellor of <hi>France.</hi> So that if I had no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Stile, to detect the Spuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> I my ſelf, indeed, ſhould be ſatisfied with that alone, but I durſt not hope to convince every body elſe. I ſhall begin therefore with another ſort of Proofs, that will affect the moſt ſlow Judgments, and aſſure the moſt timid or incredulous.</p>
                     <p>The Time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Tyranny can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preciſely determined, ſo various and defective are the Accounts of thoſe that write of him. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſets the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it Olymp. XXXI, 2. <hi>Phalaris apud Agrigentinos tyrannidem exercet;</hi> and the End of it Olymp. XXXVII, 2. <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridis tyrannis deſtructa.</hi> By which Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he governed XXVIII Years. But St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> out of ſome unknown Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologer (for that Note is not extant in the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Euſebius)</hi> gives a different Time of his Reign, above LXXX Years later than the other; Olymp. LIII, 3. or as other Copies read it, LII, 2. <hi>Phalaris tyrannidem exercuit annos</hi> XVI. Which is agreeable to <hi>Suidas,</hi> who places him, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, about the LII O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. If the former Account be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Cheat is manifeſt at firſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:180079:37"/> ſight: for thoſe Letters of <hi>Phalaris</hi> to <hi>Steſichorus</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> muſt of neceſſity be falſe. Becauſe <hi>Steſichorus</hi> was but VI Years old at that ſuppoſed time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Death; and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was not taken notice of in <hi>Greece</hi> till LXXX Years after it.

But now if <hi>Croeſus</hi> was upon that occaſion the firſt Author of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180079:44"/> Saying, what becomes of this Epiſtle? For this, as I obſerved before, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be written above a dozen years before <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s death, carries date at leaſt half a dozen before <hi>Croeſus</hi> began his reign.</p>
                     <p>Nay, there is good ground of ſuſpicion, that <hi>Herodotus</hi> himſelf, who wrote an Hundred Years after <hi>Phalaris</hi> was kill'd, was the firſt broacher of this expreſſion.

For even the <hi>Attic</hi> of the true <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s age is not there repreſented; but a more recent Idiom and Stile, that by the whole thread and colour of it betrays it ſelf to be a thouſand years younger than He. Every living Language, like the perſpiring Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of living Creatures, is in perpetual motion and alteration; ſome words go off, and become obſolete; others are taken in, and by degrees grow into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe; or the ſame word is inverted to a new ſenſe and notion; which in tract of time makes as obſervable a change in the air and features of a Language, as Age makes in the lines and mien of a Face. All are ſenſible of this in their own native Tongues, where continual Uſe makes every man a Critic. For what <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> does not think himſelf able, from the very turn and faſhion of the Stile, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

                     <p>What an inconſiſtency is there between the LI and LXIX Epiſtles? In the former he declares his immortal hatred to one <hi>Python,</hi> who, after <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s flight from <hi>Aſtypalaea,</hi> would have perſuaded his Wife <hi>Erythia</hi> to a ſecond marriage with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but ſeeing her reſolved to follow her Husband, he poiſon'd her.

                     <p>Nay certainly, they might have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed any hand, rather than <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s. For, begging pardon of the Epiſtles, I ſuſpect all to be a Cheat, about <hi>Steſichorus</hi>'s friendſhip with him. For the Poet, out of common gratitude, muſt needs have celebrated it in ſome of his Works. But that he <hi>did not,</hi> the Letters themſelves are, in this point, a ſufficient witneſs. For, in the LXXIX, <hi>Phalaris</hi> is feigned to entreat him, not once to mention his Name in his Books. This was a ſly fetch of our Sophiſt, to prevent ſo ſhrewd an objection from <hi>Steſichorus</hi>'s ſilence as to any friendſhip at all with him. But that cunning ſhall not ſerve his turn. For what if <hi>Phalaris</hi> had really wiſhed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline mentioning his Name? <hi>Steſichorus</hi> knew the World well enough, that thoſe

It muſt needs be a great wonder to thoſe that think the Letters genuine; how or where they were conceal'd, in what ſecret Cave, or unknown Corner of the World; ſo that no body ever heard of them for a thouſand years together.

                     <p> I MUST now beg the favour of one word with our late Editors of this Author. They have told the world, in their Preface, That (among other Specimens of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence) they collated the King's MS. as far as the XL Epiſtle; and would have done ſo throughout, but that the Library Keeper, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Praef. Phalar. Edit. Oxon. <hi>Manuſcripto in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliotheca Regia, cujus mihi copiam ulteriorem Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarius pro ſingulari ſua humanitate negavit.</hi>

                        <hi>out of his ſingular Humanity,</hi> denied them the further uſe of it. This was meant as a Laſh for Me, who had the Honour then and ſince to ſerve His Majeſty in that Office. I muſt own, 'twas very very reſolv'd of them, to make the Preface and the Book all of a piece; for they have acted in this Calumny both the injuſtice of the Tyrant, and the forgery of the Sophiſt. For my own part, I ſhould never have honour'd it with a Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Print, but have given it the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that is due to Weak Detraction; had I not been engaged to my Friend, to write this Cenſure upon <hi>Phalaris;</hi> where to omit to take notice of that Slander, would be tacitly to own it. The true ſtory is thus: A Bookſeller came to me, in the name of the Editors, to beg the uſe of the Manuſcript. It was not then in my cuſtody: but as ſoon as I had the power
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:180079:63"/> of it, I went voluntarily and offer'd it him; bidding him tell the Collator not to loſe any time; for I was ſhortly to go out of Town for two Months. 'Twas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, uſed, and return'd. Not a word ſaid by the Bearer, nor the leaſt ſuſpicion in me, that they had not finiſh'd the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. For, I ſpeak from experiment, they had more Days to compare it in, than they needed to have Hours. 'Tis a very little Book, and the Writing as legible as Print. Well, the Collation, it ſeems, was ſent defective to <hi>Oxon;</hi> and the blame, I ſuppoſe, laid upon Me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd again to the Library, ſome months before the Edition was finiſh'd: No appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was made for further uſe of the Manuſcript. Thence I went for a whole fortnight to <hi>Oxon,</hi> where the Book was then printing; converſed in the very College where the Editors reſided. Not the leaſt whiſper there of the Manuſcript. After a few weeks, out comes the new Edition, with this Sting in the Mouth of it. 'Twas a ſurprize, indeed, to read there, that our Manuſcript was not peruſed. Could not they have ask'd for it again, then, after my return? 'Twas neither <hi>ſingular,</hi> nor common <hi>Humanity,</hi> not to enquire into the truth of the thing; before they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to Print, which is a Sword in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:180079:64"/> Hand of a Child. But there is a reaſon for every thing; and the myſtery was ſoon revealed. As for the King's Manuſcript, they had no want nor deſire of it; for, as I ſhall ſhew by and by, they had neither induſtry nor skill to uſe either That or their Own. And for my part; I, it ſeems, had the hard hap, in ſome private conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to ſay the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were a ſpurious Piece, and unworthy of a new Edition. <hi>Hinc illae lachrimae.</hi> This was a thing deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſented; and to have ſpoken to me about the Manuſcript, had been to loſe a plauſible occaſion of taking revenge.</p>

                        <hi>Pro ſingulari ſua humanitate!</hi> I could produce ſeveral Letters from learned Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors abroad, whoſe Books our Editors may in time be fit to read; wherein theſe very ſame words are ſaid of me candidly and ſeriouſly.

And I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh, that I could do any ſervice to that young Gentleman of great Hopes, whoſe Name is ſet to the Edition. I can do him no greater at preſent, than to remove ſome blemiſhes from the Book that is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him: which I deſire may be taken aright; to be no diſparagement to himſelf, but a reproof only to his Teachers.</p>

The Subject of many of the Letters is Common place; mere Chat, and telling a Tale, without any Buſineſs; an Errand not worth ſending to the next Town, much leſs to be brought from remote Countries ſome hundreds of Leagues.

The XIX is to <hi>Pauſanias</hi> again; but after his Conſpiracy was detected. Here he tells the Particulars of that Plot as exactly, as if he had been one of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> that over-heard it. Nay, he foretells him, that the <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> would take away his life. Now beſides that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> would ſcorn to inſult ſo, and rail to no purpoſe, as this Letter does; he would ſurely have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:180079:73"/> had more wit, than knowingly to write to the Dead. For at the ſame time he heard thoſe Particulars of <hi>Pauſanias</hi>'s Treaſon, he muſt needs hear of his Execution; ſince thoſe things were not known till after his Death, and the rifling of his Papers. The VI Epiſtle is a long Narrative of the whole buſineſs of <hi>Pauſanias:</hi> for that was a Subject worthy of Eloquence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was to receive ornament from the Pen of the Sophiſt. But it was ſcarce worthy of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> to ſend ſuch a long News-Letter to <hi>Athens;</hi> where, in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the Story was common, before he heard of it himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But how ſhall we reconcile this Affair of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> according to the Letters, with what <hi>Diodorus</hi> has left us upon the ſame Subject?

                        </q> This, indeed, might draw the Sophiſt and ſome others into a miſtake.

                     <p>THE <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and his Scholars, <hi>Xenophon, Ariſtippus,</hi> &amp;c. were publiſh'd out of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library by the Learned <hi>Leo Allatius;</hi> and printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> MDCXXXVII. He was ſo fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded himſelf, and ſo concerned to have others think, that they are the legitimate Off-ſpring of thoſe Authors they are laid to; that he has guarded and protected them, in a Dialogue of LVII Pages in <hi>quarto,</hi> againſt all the Objections that He or his Friends could raiſe. And no body ſince, that ever I heard of, has brought the matter into controverſie. But I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that by that time I have done with them, it will be no more a Controverſie, but that they are ſpurious. I ſhall make uſe of nothing that <hi>Allatius</hi> has brought, except one Objection only; and that I ſhall both manage in a new way, and defend it againſt all his Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The Firſt Letter is <hi>Socrates</hi>'s to ſome King, 'tis ſuppoſed to <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> in which he refuſes to go to

                        <hi>The King offer'd him part of his Kingdom;</hi> and, <hi>that he ſhould not come thither to be commanded, but to command both his Subjects and Himſelf.</hi> Can you deſire a better token of a Sophiſt, than this? 'Tis a fine offer, indeed, to a poor old Man, that had nothing but his Staff and one Coat to his back. But a Sophiſt abhorrs mediocrity; he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſay the greateſt thing; and make a Tide and a Flood, though it be but in a Baſon of Water.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Well; our Philoſopher goes on, and give a reaſons of his refuſal; That his Daemon forbid him to go: and then he falls into the long ſtory of what happen'd to him in the Battle at <hi>Delium;</hi> which was a tale of twenty years ſtanding at the date of this Letter. But the Sophiſt had read it in <hi>Plato;</hi> and he would not miſs the opportunity of an eloquent Narration. I will not here inſiſt upon the teſtimony of <note n="(t)" place="margin">Lib. v. p. 215.</note> 
                        <hi>Athenaeus;</hi> That the whole buſineſs
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180079:75"/> is a mere fiction of <hi>Plato</hi>'s: let that be left in the middle. But we may ſafely inferr thus much from it; That even <hi>Athenaeus</hi> himſelf, whoſe curioſity nothing eſcaped, never met with theſe Epiſtles. Which alone creates a juſt ſuſpicion, that they were forged ſince his days; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the univerſal ſilence of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity gives a general conſent to it.</p>
                     <p>There's a paſſage, indeed, in <note n="(x)" place="margin">Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Socrat.</note> 
                        <hi>Libanius,</hi> which, in <hi>Allatius</hi>'s judgment, ſeems plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to declare, that he had ſeen this very Epiſtle. For after he had mention'd <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s refuſal to go to <hi>Scopas,</hi> and <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochus,</hi> and <hi>Archelaus;</hi> he adds; <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Now ſhould we concede, what <hi>Allatius</hi> would have; this is all that can be inferred from thence in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; That they are older than <hi>Libanius;</hi> which I am willing to believe: and, That He believed them true; which I matter not at all. For ſo we have ſeen <hi>Stobaeus, Suidas</hi> and others, cry up <hi>Phalaris</hi> for a genuine Book; and yet I fanſie none of my Readers are now of their opinion. But with <hi>Allatius</hi>'s good leave, I would draw the words of <hi>Libanius</hi> to a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary purpoſe. After he had ſaid, that many Princes had ſollicited <hi>Socrates,</hi> by Letter, to come and live in their Courts;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180079:76"/> and he anſwer'd them all with a denial: <hi>But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I want the Letters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; in which you might perfectly ſee the Spirit of the Man.</hi> This, to me, is an indication, that the Letters he means were not extant. For if he had them in his hand, according to <hi>Allatius,</hi> how could he <hi>want</hi> them? And 'tis plain, he ſpeaks here of ſeveral Letters, being Replies to ſeveral Meſſages; but in this Collection here's but a ſingle one. <hi>I wiſh</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Letters were to be had; in thoſe you might read his Character.</hi> If this be the ſenſe of thoſe words, as probably it is; <hi>Libanius</hi> is ſo far from being Patron to our Epiſtles, that he is a poſitive Witneſs againſt them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The VII Letter is writ by <hi>Socrates</hi> to one of thoſe that had fled to <hi>Thebes</hi> from the violence of the XXX Tyrants: in which he gives him an account of the ſtate of <hi>Athens</hi> ſince their departure; <hi>That him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was now hated by the Tyrants, becauſe he would have no hand in the condemnation of</hi> Leon <hi>the</hi> Salaminian: and then he tells the ſtory at large. Now, here's a manifeſt diſcovery that the Letters are ſuppoſititious. For the buſineſs of <hi>Leon</hi> was quite over, before thoſe Fugitives left the Town.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:180079:83"/> What grounds they proceeded on I cannot now tell; but I think there is apparent reaſon for rejecting the ſtory, even laying aſide their teſtimony.

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſuſpects that Book to be ſpurious. So that all this Tradition roſe at firſt from a Falſary, that counterfeited <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s name. Beſides, they do not agree in telling their tale; one ſays, that he had both Wives together: another, that <hi>Myrto</hi> was his firſt Wife, and the ſecond came after her death: another, that <hi>Xanthippe</hi> was the firſt. Let either of them come firſt, and our Epiſtles are falſe; for here we have Both ſurviving him, and living together. <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> One ſays, this <hi>Myrto</hi> was <hi>Ariſtides</hi>'s Daughter; another his Grand-daughter; and another, his Grandſon's Daughter. Whatſoever ſhe was; if ſhe outliv'd her Husband, according to the Letters, pray where was her Ladyſhip at the time of his ſuffering? <note n="(e)" place="margin">Plato Apolog.</note> 
                        <hi>Xanthippe,</hi> like a loving Wife, attended him in the Priſon; but the other ne'er came near him. 'Tis a miſtake, ſure, that has paſt upon the world, that <hi>Xanthippe</hi> was the Scold: it ſhould ſeem, that <hi>Myrto</hi> had the better

But what ſhall we ſay to <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> who brings you the very Statute, that gave allowance of two Wives at once? <hi>Panaetius,</hi> you ſee, believed it not: and why may not a Statute be forged, as eaſily as theſe Epiſtles? If there was ſuch an Act, there appears no great wiſdom in it. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there is near an equality in the births of Males and Females. So that if ſome Men had two Wives for their ſhare, others muſt go without: and what remedy would that be againſt the ſcarcity of People? Beſides that by ſuch a Law the Rich only would be accommodated, who were able to maintain a couple: the poorer ſort, who are always the moſt fruitful, would be in worſe circumſtances than before. And without doubt, a very ſtrong intereſt would have been made againſt the paſſing of ſuch a Bill; <note n="(f)" place="margin">

                        </q> This we are told by the Writer of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s Life, no unlearned Author: who does not contradict him about theſe of <hi>Euripides;</hi> but for <hi>Aratus</hi>'s, he ſays, that, bating this <hi>Apollonides,</hi> every body elſe believed them to be genuine. I cannot paſs any judgment of what I never ſaw; for <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Letters are not now to be had: but if they were no better than theſe of our Tragedian, I ſhould, in ſpite of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vogue, be of <hi>Apollonides</hi>'s mind; and I wiſh that Book of his were now extant. One may know, by the manner of the Name, that this <hi>Sabirius Pollo</hi> was a <hi>Roman:</hi> but I do not find ſuch a Family as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birii,</hi> nor ſuch a Sirname as <hi>Pollo.</hi> What if we read <hi>Sabinius,</hi> or <hi>Sabidius Pollio?</hi>
                        <q>Non amo te, Sabidi; nec poſſum dicere quare.</q>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:180079:88"/> If that <hi>Sabidius</hi> in <hi>Martial</hi> was the forger of our Epiſtles; though the Poet could give none, yet I can give a very good reaſon, why I do not love him.</p>
                     <p>But the Learned Advocate for the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters makes ſeveral Exceptions againſt the Teſtimony of <hi>Apollonides.</hi> As firſt, <hi>That we may fairly inferr from it, that a great many others believed them to be true.</hi> Alas! How many more, both Ancients and Moderns, believed <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s to be true? If that argument would have done the work, I might have ſpared this Diſſertation. <hi>But prove, that theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now extant are the ſame that were forged by</hi> Sabirius. Commend to me an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that, like a Flail, there's no fence againſt it. Why, had we been told too, that he made <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles:</hi> yet how could we <hi>prove,</hi> unleſs ſome paſſages were cited out of them, that they were the ſame that we have now? But though I cannot demonſtrate that theſe are <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birius</hi>'s; yet I'll demonſtrate them by and by to be an Impoſture; and I hope then it will be no injuſtice to lay them at his door. <hi>But 'tis an evidence, that the true</hi> Epiſtles of Euripides <hi>were once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; becauſe ſome body thought it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to father falſe ones upon him.</hi> Now, I ſhould think the very contrary; that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:180079:88"/> the Cuckow does not lay her Egg, where the Neſt is already full. At leaſt, I am reſolved I'll never go a book-hunting after the genuine Epiſtles of <hi>Phalaris;</hi> though ſome body has cheated the World with a parcel of falſe ones.</p>

                     <p>The very Learned Defender of the Epiſtles, one of a ſingular Induſtry and a moſt diffuſe Reading, has propoſed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180079:90"/> ſome Objections againſt the Letters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him by a private Hand.

                     <p n="4">IV. Our friend <hi>Sabirius Pollo,</hi> to make the whole Work throughout worthy of himſelf, has directed this ſame Letter to <hi>Cephiſophon,</hi> who was <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Actor for his Plays. For he had often heard of <hi>Cephiſophon;</hi> and ſo he would not let him paſs without a ſhare in his Epiſtles. But he ſhould have minded Time and Hiſtory a little better, if he hoped to put himſelf upon Us for the Author he mimic's. 'Tis true, <hi>Cephiſophon</hi> and our Poet were once mighty dear acquaintance: but there fell out a foul accident, that broke off the friendſhip. For <hi>Euripides</hi> caught him Acting for him, not upon the Stage, but in private with his Wife.

But perhaps I may be <hi>exhorted</hi> hereafter to put this Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into <hi>Latin,</hi> with large Additions: till which time I will adjourn the further Diſcourſe upon thoſe ſeveral Authors; and proceed now to the laſt thing propoſed, <hi>The Fables of Aeſop.</hi>

                     <p> And here I am glad to find a good part of the Work done ready to my hand. For Monſieur <hi>Bachet S. de Meziriac,</hi> has writ <hi>The Life of Aeſop,</hi> in <hi>French:</hi> which Book, though I could never meet with it, I can gueſs from the great Learning of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, known to me by his other Works, to have in a manner exhauſted the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. <hi>Vavaſor</hi> too, <hi>De Ludicra Dictione,</hi> aſcribes the preſent <hi>Fables</hi> to <hi>Maximus Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudes,</hi> and not to <hi>Aeſop</hi> himſelf. See alſo a great deal upon this Head in the late <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Dictionary</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baile.</hi> All which make me look upon Sir <hi>W. T.</hi>'s mighty Commendation of the <hi>Aeſopean Fables</hi> now extant, which is the occaſion of this Treatiſe, to be an unhappy Paradox; neither worthy of the great Author, nor agreeable to the reſt of his excellent Book. For if I do not much deceive my ſelf, I ſhall ſoon make it appear, That of all the Compoſitions of the <hi>Aeſopic Fables,</hi> theſe that we have now left us, are both the Laſt and the Worſt. Though I do not intend a ſet Diſcourſe; but only a few looſe things, that I fanſie may have eſcaped the Obſervation of Others.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:180079:101"/> proof. For that is a ſtory of <hi>Demades</hi> the Rhetor, who lived above CC years after our <hi>Phrygian</hi>'s time.
